### `> whoami`
Hey 👋 I'm John, a Software Engineer working out of Dundee, Scotland. There's no place like `127.0.0.1`.

### `> current_status`
- 🏢 Engineering at [Candescent](https://www.candescent.com/)
- 🌱 Upskilling in Cloud Services & Agentic Workflows (so I can eventually automate myself out of a job).
- 🏠 Accidentally taking down my own home network while "optimizing" my Docker containers.

### `> echo $TECH_STACK`
`TypeScript` | `Java` | `C#` | `Cassandra` | `Kafka` | `Kubernetes`
*(Warning: May occasionally talk too much about event-driven architecture.)*

### `> ping -c 1 john_nooney`
Always down to chat about software, self-hosting, and automation!
